Hi! Let me introduce myself, I'm LovePoison, a cybersecurity and ethical hacking student currently diving into the world of Python!
My goal is to keep learning Python as my future-to-be main programming language to be able to code my own tools and stuff...
I will be uploading my simple Python projects as I go, so if you want to teach me something about Python or anything contact me at LovePoison@protonmail.com or through GitHub, I'm always eager to learn!
