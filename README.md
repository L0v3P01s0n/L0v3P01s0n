Hi! Let me introduce myself, I'm LovePoison, a cybersecurity and ethical hacking student!
My goal is to code my own tools and stuff (now I'm really focusing on the PinePhone a lot, and I'm also using it as my daily driver ðŸ¤©), and of course I'll keep learning about security more and more...
I will be uploading my projects as I go, so if you want to contribute, discuss or tell me anything contact me at @l0v3p0150n:matrix.org, my Telegram (https://t.me/L0V3P0150N) or through GitHub, I'm always eager to learn!
You can donate me at https://ko-fi.com/l0v3p01s0n ^_^
